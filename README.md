Experimentation with linear regression and ridge regression using 1990 California housing data per block

Data sourced from www.kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price/data 

Ridge, Lasso, and Linear models have practically equivalent R2 and RMSE scores, likely as a result of the relatively low dimensionality. I am planning on also using this dataset to implement a KNN classification model to predict the ocean_proximity categorical variable.
